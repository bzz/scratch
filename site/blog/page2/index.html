				<h2><a href="/news/2014/01/26/optimizer_plan_visualization_tool.html">Optimizer Plan Visualization Tool</a></h2>
				<p class="meta">26 Jan 2014</p>
				
				<div><p>Stratosphere&#39;s hybrid approach combines <strong>MapReduce</strong> and <strong>MPP database</strong> techniques. One central part of this approach is to have a <strong>separation between the programming (API) and the way programs are executed</strong> <em>(execution plans)</em>. The <strong>compiler/optimizer</strong> decides the details concerning caching or when to partition/broadcast with a holistic view of the program. The same program may actually be executed differently in different scenarios (input data of different sizes, different number of machines).</p>

<p><strong>If you want to know how exactly the system executes your program, you can find it out in two ways</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The <strong>browser-based webclient UI</strong>, which takes programs packaged into JARs and draws the execution plan as a visual data flow (check out the <a href="http://stratosphere.eu/docs/0.4/program_execution/web_interface.html">documentation</a> for details).</p></li>
<li><p>For <strong>programs using the <a href="http://stratosphere.eu/docs/0.4/program_execution/local_executor.html">Local- </a> or <a href="http://stratosphere.eu/docs/0.4/program_execution/remote_executor.html">Remote Executor</a></strong>, you can get the optimizer plan using the method <code>LocalExecutor.optimizerPlanAsJSON(plan)</code>. The <strong>resulting JSON</strong> string describes the execution strategies chosen by the optimizer. Naturally, you do not want to parse that yourself, especially for longer programs.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The builds <em>0.5-SNAPSHOT</em> and later come with a <strong>tool that visualizes the JSON</strong> string. It is a standalone version of the webclient&#39;s visualization, packed as an html document <code>tools/planVisualizer.html</code>.</p>

<p>If you open it in a browser (for example <code>chromium-browser tools/planVisualizer.html</code>) it shows a text area where you can paste the JSON string and it renders that string as a dataflow plan (assuming it was a valid JSON string and plan). The pictures below show how that looks for the <a href="https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/blob/release-0.4/stratosphere-examples/stratosphere-java-examples/src/main/java/eu/stratosphere/example/java/record/connectedcomponents/WorksetConnectedComponents.java?source=cc">included sample program</a> that uses delta iterations to compute the connected components of a graph.</p>

				<h2><a href="/news/2014/01/13/stratosphere-release-0.4.html">Stratosphere 0.4 Released</a></h2>
				<p class="meta">13 Jan 2014</p>
				
				<div><p>We are pleased to announce that version 0.4 of the Stratosphere system has been released. </p>

<p>Our team has been working hard during the last few months to create an improved and stable Stratosphere version. The new version comes with many new features, usability and performance improvements in all levels, including a new Scala API for the concise specification of programs, a Pregel-like API, support for Yarn clusters, and major performance improvements. The system features now first-class support for iterative programs and thus covers traditional analytical use cases as well as data mining and graph processing use cases with great performance.</p>

<p>In the course of the transition from v0.2 to v0.4 of the system, we have changed pre-existing APIs based on valuable user feedback. This means that, in the interest of easier programming, we have broken backwards compatibility and existing jobs must be adapted, as described in <a href="/blog/tutorial/2014/01/12/0.4-migration-guide.html">the migration guide</a>.</p>

<p>This article will guide you through the feature list of the new release.</p>

<h3 id="scala-programming-interface">Scala Programming Interface</h3>

<p>The new Stratosphere version comes with a new programming API in Scala that supports very fluent and efficient programs that can be expressed with very few lines of code. The API uses Scala&#39;s native type system (no special boxed data types) and supports grouping and joining on types beyond key/value pairs. We use code analysis and code generation to transform Scala&#39;s data model to the Stratosphere runtime. Stratosphere Scala programs are optimized before execution by Stratosphere&#39;s optimizer just like Stratosphere Java programs.</p>

<p>Learn more about the Scala API at the <a href="/docs/0.4/programming_guides/scala.html">Scala Programming Guide</a></p>

<h3 id="iterations">Iterations</h3>

<p>Stratosphere v0.4 introduces deep support for iterative algorithms, required by a large class of advanced analysis algorithms. In contrast to most other systems, &quot;looping over the data&quot; is done inside the system&#39;s runtime, rather than in the client. Individual iterations (supersteps) can be as fast as sub-second times. Loop-invariant data is automatically cached in memory.</p>

<p>We support a special form of iterations called “delta iterations” that selectively modify only some elements of intermediate solution in each iteration. These are applicable to a variety of applications, e.g., use cases of Apache Giraph. We have observed speedups of 70x when using delta iterations instead of regular iterations.</p>

<p>Read more about the new iteration feature in <a href="/docs/0.4/programming_guides/iterations.html">the documentation</a></p>

<h3 id="hadoop-yarn-support">Hadoop YARN Support</h3>

<p>YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is the major new feature of the recently announced <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.2.0/">Hadoop 2.2</a>. It allows to share existing clusters with different runtimes. So you can run MapReduce alongside Storm and others. With the 0.4 release, Stratosphere supports YARN.
Follow <a href="/docs/0.4/setup/yarn.html">our guide</a> on how to start a Stratosphere YARN session.</p>

<h3 id="improved-scripting-language-meteor">Improved Scripting Language Meteor</h3>

<p>The high-level language Meteor now natively serializes JSON trees for greater performance and offers additional operators and file formats. We greatly empowered the user to write crispier scripts by adding second-order functions, multi-output operators, and other syntactical sugar. For developers of Meteor packages, the API is much more comprehensive and allows to define custom data types that can be easily embedded in JSON trees through ad-hoc byte code generation.</p>

<h3 id="spargel:-pregel-inspired-graph-processing">Spargel: Pregel Inspired Graph Processing</h3>

<p>Spargel is a vertex-centric API similar to the interface proposed in Google&#39;s Pregel paper and implemented in Apache Giraph. Spargel is implemented in 500 lines of code (including comments) on top of Stratosphere&#39;s delta iterations feature. This confirms the flexibility of Stratosphere&#39;s architecture. </p>

<h3 id="web-frontend">Web Frontend</h3>

<p>Using the new web frontend, you can monitor the progress of Stratosphere jobs. For finished jobs, the frontend shows a breakdown of the execution times for each operator. The webclient also visualizes the execution strategies chosen by the optimizer.</p>

<h3 id="accumulators">Accumulators</h3>

<p>Stratosphere&#39;s accumulators allow program developers to compute simple statistics, such as counts, sums, min/max values, or histograms, as a side effect of the processing functions. An example application would be to count the total number of records/tuples processed by a function. Stratosphere will not launch additional tasks (reducers), but will compute the number &quot;on the fly&quot; as a side-product of the functions application to the data. The concept is similar to Hadoop&#39;s counters, but supports more types of aggregation.</p>

<h3 id="refactored-apis">Refactored APIs</h3>

<p>Based on valuable user feedback, we refactored the Java programming interface to make it more intuitive and easier to use. The basic concepts are still the same, however the naming of most interfaces changed and the structure of the code was adapted. When updating to the 0.4 release you will need to adapt your jobs and dependencies. A previous blog post has a guide to the necessary changes to adapt programs to Stratosphere 0.4.</p>

<h3 id="local-debugging">Local Debugging</h3>

<p>You can now test and debug Stratosphere jobs locally. The <a href="/docs/0.4/program_execution/local_executor.html">LocalExecutor</a> allows to execute Stratosphere Jobs from IDE&#39;s. The same code that runs on clusters also runs in a single JVM multi-threaded. The mode supports full debugging capabilities known from regular applications (placing breakpoints and stepping through the program&#39;s functions). An advanced mode supports simulating fully distributed operation locally.</p>

<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
<li>The configuration of Stratosphere has been changed to YAML</li>
<li>HBase support</li>
<li>JDBC Input format</li>
<li>Improved Windows Compatibility: Batch-files to start Stratosphere on Windows and all unit tests passing on Windows.</li>

				<h2><a href="/news/2014/01/12/0.4-migration-guide.html">Stratosphere Version 0.4 Migration Guide</a></h2>
				<p class="meta">12 Jan 2014</p>
				
				<div><p><strong>This guide is intended to help users of previous Stratosphere versions to migrate their programs to the new API of v0.4.</strong></p>

<p>Version <code>0.4-rc1</code>, <code>0.4</code> and all newer versions have the new API. If you want to have the most recent version before the code change, please set the version to <code>0.4-alpha.3-SNAPSHOT</code>. (Note that the <code>0.4-alpha</code> versions are only available in the snapshot repository).</p>

<h4 id="maven-dependencies">Maven Dependencies</h4>

<p>Since we also reorganized the Maven project structure, existing programs need to update the Maven dependencies to <code>stratosphere-java</code> (and <code>stratosphere-clients</code>, for examples and executors).</p>

<p>The typical set of Maven dependencies for Stratosphere Java programs is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff">       &lt;groupId&gt;eu.stratosphere&lt;/groupId&gt;
<span class="gd">-      &lt;artifactId&gt;pact-common&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
<span class="gd">-      &lt;version&gt;0.4-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;</span>
<span class="gi">+      &lt;artifactId&gt;stratosphere-java&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
<span class="gi">+      &lt;version&gt;0.4&lt;/version&gt;</span>

<span class="gd">-      &lt;artifactId&gt;pact-clients&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
<span class="gd">-      &lt;version&gt;0.4-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;</span>
<span class="gi">+      &lt;artifactId&gt;stratosphere-clients&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
<span class="gi">+      &lt;version&gt;0.4&lt;/version&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="renamed-classes">Renamed classes</h4>

<p>We renamed many of the most commonly used classes to make their names more intuitive:</p>

<table class="table table-striped">
  <thead>
    <tr>
    <th>Old Name (before <code>0.4</code>)</th>
    <th>New Name (<code>0.4</code> and after)</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Contract</td>
        <td>Operator</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>MatchContract</td>
        <td>JoinOperator</td>
      </tr>

          <tr>
        <td>[Map, Reduce, ...]Stub</td>
        <td>[Map, Reduce, ...]Function</td>
      </tr>
          <tr>
        <td>MatchStub</td>
        <td>JoinFunction</td>
      </tr>
          <tr>
        <td>Pact[Integer, Double, ...]</td>
        <td>IntValue, DoubleValue, ...</td>
      </tr>   
      <tr>
        <td>PactRecord</td>
        <td>Record</td>
      </tr>
          <tr>
        <td>PlanAssembler</td>
        <td>Program</td>
      </tr>
          <tr>
        <td>PlanAssemblerDescription</td>
        <td>ProgramDescription</td>
      </tr>
          <tr>
        <td>RecordOutputFormat</td>
        <td>CsvOutputFormat</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Package names have been adapted as well.
For a complete overview of the renamings, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/issues/257">issue #257 on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>We suggest for Eclipse user adjust the programs as follows: Delete all old Stratosphere imports, then rename the the classes (<code>PactRecord</code> to <code>Record</code> and so on). Finally, use the “Organize Imports” function (<code>CTRL+SHIFT+O</code>) to choose the right imports. The names should be unique so always pick the classes that are in the <code>eu.stratosphere</code> package.</p>

<p>Please contact us in the comments below, on the mailing list or on GitHub if you have any issues migrating to the latest Stratosphere release.</p>

				<h2><a href="/news/2013/10/21/cikm2013-paper.html">Paper "“All Roads Lead to Rome:” Optimistic Recovery for Distributed Iterative Data Processing" accepted at CIKM 2013</a></h2>
				<p class="meta">21 Oct 2013</p>
				
				<div><p>Our paper &quot;“All Roads Lead to Rome:” Optimistic Recovery for Distributed
Iterative Data Processing&quot; authored by Sebastian Schelter, Kostas
Tzoumas, Stephan Ewen and Volker Markl has been accepted accepted at the
ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management
(CIKM 2013) in San Francisco.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>Executing data-parallel iterative algorithms on large datasets is
crucial for many advanced analytical applications in the fields of data
mining and machine learning. Current systems for executing iterative
tasks in large clusters typically achieve fault tolerance through
rollback recovery. The principle behind this pessimistic approach is to
periodically checkpoint the algorithm state. Upon failure, the system
restores a consistent state from a previously written checkpoint and
resumes execution from that point.</p>

<p>We propose an optimistic recovery mechanism using algorithmic
compensations. Our method leverages the robust, self-correcting nature
of a large class of fixpoint algorithms used in data mining and machine
learning, which converge to the correct solution from various
intermediate consistent states. In the case of a failure, we apply a
user-defined compensate function that algorithmically creates such a
consistent state, instead of rolling back to a previous checkpointed
state. Our optimistic recovery does not checkpoint any state and hence
achieves optimal failure-free performance with respect to the overhead
necessary for guaranteeing fault tolerance. We illustrate the
applicability of this approach for three wide classes of problems.
Furthermore, we show how to implement the proposed optimistic recovery
mechanism in a data flow system. Similar to the Combine operator in
MapReduce, our proposed functionality is optional and can be applied to
increase performance without changing the semantics of programs. In an
experimental evaluation on large datasets, we show that our proposed
approach provides optimal failure-free performance. In the absence of
failures our optimistic scheme is able to outperform a pessimistic
approach by a factor of two to five. In presence of failures, our
approach provides fast recovery and outperforms pessimistic approaches
in the majority of cases.</p>

				<p class="meta">27 Mar 2013</p>
				
				<div>   <p>Our demo submission<br />
<strong><cite>"Large-Scale Social-Media Analytics on Stratosphere"</cite></strong><br />
by Christoph Boden, Marcel Karnstedt, Miriam Fernandez and Volker Markl<br />
has been accepted for WWW 2013 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
The importance of social-media platforms and online communities - in business as well as public context - is more and more acknowledged and appreciated by industry and researchers alike. Consequently, a wide range of analytics has been proposed to understand, steer, and exploit the mechanics and laws driving their functionality and creating the resulting benefits. However, analysts usually face significant problems in scaling existing and novel approaches to match the data volume and size of modern online communities. In this work, we propose and demonstrate the usage of the massively parallel data prossesing system Stratosphere, based on second order functions as an extended notion of the MapReduce paradigm, to provide a new level of scalability to such social-media analytics. Based on the popular example of role analysis, we present and illustrate how this massively parallel approach can be leveraged to scale out complex data-mining tasks, while providing a programming approach that eases the formulation of complete analytical workflows.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
Analyzing big data sets as they occur in modern business and science applications requires query languages that allow for the specification of complex data processing tasks. Moreover, these ideally declarative query specifications have to be optimized, parallelized and scheduled for processing on massively parallel data processing platforms. This paper demonstrates the application of Stratosphere to different kinds of Big Data Analytics tasks. Using examples from different application domains, we show how to formulate analytical tasks as Meteor queries and execute them with Stratosphere. These examples include data cleansing and information extraction tasks, and a correlation analysis of microblogging and stock trade volume data that we describe in detail in this paper.</p>

<strong><cite>"Peeking into the Optimization of Data Flow Programs with MapReduce-style UDFs"</cite></strong><br />
has been accepted for ICDE 2013 in Brisbane, Australia.<br />
The demo illustrates the contributions of our VLDB 2012 paper <cite>"Opening the Black Boxes in Data Flow Optimization"</cite> <a href="/assets/papers/optimizationOfDataFlowsWithUDFs_13.pdf">[PDF]</a> and <a href="/assets/papers/optimizationOfDataFlowsWithUDFs_poster_13.pdf">[Poster PDF]</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
Data flows are a popular abstraction to define data-intensive processing tasks. In order to support a wide range of use cases, many data processing systems feature MapReduce-style user-defined functions (UDFs). In contrast to UDFs as known from relational DBMS, MapReduce-style UDFs have less strict templates. These templates do not alone provide all the information needed to decide whether they can be reordered with relational operators and other UDFs. However, it is well-known that reordering operators such as filters, joins, and aggregations can yield runtime improvements by orders of magnitude.<br />
We demonstrate an optimizer for data flows that is able to reorder operators with MapReduce-style UDFs written in an imperative language. Our approach leverages static code analysis to extract information from UDFs which is used to reason about the reorderbility of UDF operators. This information is sufficient to enumerate a large fraction of the search space covered by conventional RDBMS optimizers including filter and aggregation push-down, bushy join orders, and choice of physical execution strategies based on interesting properties.<br />
We demonstrate our optimizer and a job submission client that allows users to peek step-by-step into each phase of the optimization process: the static code analysis of UDFs, the enumeration of reordered candidate data flows, the generation of physical execution plans, and their parallel execution. For the demonstration, we provide a selection of relational and non-relational data flow programs which highlight the salient features of our approach.</p>

		<p>Apache Flink is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache

			Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further
			review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and
			decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
			other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not
			necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
			code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed
